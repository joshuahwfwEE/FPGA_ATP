this repos will explain some basic concept and brings on some relative lab  

1. how a LUT4 and a LUT6 can be composed to a multiplier ?  
   multiply two 4-bit numbers, resulting in an 8-bit product.  
   
2. how carry chain work? in ultrascale+ (carry8)
   
3. what is the relationship between CLB, slice, LUT
